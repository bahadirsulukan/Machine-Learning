# Machine Learning 🤖

This folder contains my **machine learning exercises and small projects**, mainly based on Kaggle challenges and practical experiments.

The goal of this collection is to build a **strong foundation in ML and AI**, as part of my long-term path toward **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and data-driven systems.

## 🚢 Titanic – Survival Prediction (Kaggle)

**Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** is one of my first completed ML exercises.

**Objective:**  
Predict passenger survival based on features such as age, gender, passenger class, and family relationships.

**What I focused on:**
- Data exploration and preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Feature selection  
- Training and evaluating basic ML models  
- Understanding model performance and limitations  

**Tools & Technologies:**  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

## 🎬 TMDB – Box Office Revenue Prediction (Kaggle)

This project is based on the Kaggle competition **“TMDB Box Office Prediction”**, where the goal is to predict a movie’s **worldwide box office revenue** using metadata available *before the movie’s release*.

**Objective:**  
Predict movie revenue based on features such as budget, cast & crew information, genres, release dates, production companies, languages, and plot-related metadata.

**What I focused on:**
- Working with a larger and more complex real-world dataset  
- Handling missing values and noisy data  
- Feature preprocessing for numerical and categorical variables  
- Understanding how factors like budget and release timing influence revenue  
- Training and evaluating regression-based machine learning models  

**Tools & Technologies:**  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
